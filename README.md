# Diploma — Cheatsheet: spouse frailty models

A compact cheatsheet from my 2023 Moscow State University thesis. I derive formulas for a Bayesian mortality model of a spouse couple (Freund-style frailty). This repository demonstrates my ability to reason about stochastic processes and apply Bayesian inference; it is not intended as a tutorial or a polished library. It is not expected that you will be able to understand anything at all.

## Reference:
"Love and death: a freund model with frailty", C. Gourieroux and Y. Lu
(primary paper used in derivations).


## Purpose & scope
This repo is a technical record of my thesis work: derivations, intermediate calculations, simulation experiments and exploratory plotting.
It is intentionally concise and math-heavy — you are not expected to follow every step without domain background.
The goal is to show capability in stochastic modelling and Bayesian reasoning rather than to provide end-user documentation.

## Authorship & provenance
Author: thesis work completed in 2023 at Moscow State University.
Purpose: research notes and demonstration of modelling skill.

**Important note (tooling & timeline)**:
The formulas and primary code were written in the pre-LLM era (2023). Coding assistants were used later only to help add docstrings and small refactors, as well as writing this README; the mathematical derivations and modelling choices are the author's original work.
